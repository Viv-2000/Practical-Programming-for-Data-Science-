Indicator definition	

* Definition: School-age digital connectivity data set â€“ Percentage of children in a school attendance age (approximately 3-17 years old depending on the country) that have internet connection at home

Glossary - the database contains the following	
* ISO: Three-digit alphabetical codes International Standard ISO 3166-1 assigned by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The latest version is available online at http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/country_codes.htm. (column A)
* Countries and areas: The UNICEF Global databases contain a set of 202 countries as reported on through the State of the World's Children Statistical Annex 2017 (column B)
	
* Data Source: Short name for data source, followed by the year(s) in which the data collection (e.g., survey interviews) took place (column K)
* Time period: Represents the year(s) in which the data collection (e.g. survey interviews) took place. (column L)
	
* Region, Sub-region: UNICEF regions (column C) and UNICEF Sub-regions (column D)
EAP	East Asia and the Pacific
ECA	Europe and Central Asia
EECA	Eastern Europe and Central Asia
ESA	Eastern and Southern Africa
LAC	Latin America and the Caribbean
MENA	Middle East and North Africa
NA	North America
SA	South Asia

* Development regions: Economies are currently divided into four income groupings: low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high. Income is measured using gross national income (GNI) per capita, in U.S. dollars, converted from local currency using the World Bank Atlas method (column E).

* Total: The overall percentage of children in a school attendance age that have internet connection at home

* Rural (Residence): The percentage of children (live in rural area) in a school attendance age that have internet connection at home
	
* Urban (Residence): The percentage of children (live in urban area) in a school attendance age that have internet connection at home
(For Residence, there are only two values: Rural and Urban)

* Poorest (Wealth quintile): The percentage of children (from the poorest according to wealth quintile) in a school attendance age that have internet connection at home

* Richest (Wealth quintile): The percentage of children (from the poorest according to wealth quintile) in a school attendance age that have internet connection at home


Data Files: 
* Total School Age: The data about all children in a school attendance age (approximately 3-17 years old depending on the country)
